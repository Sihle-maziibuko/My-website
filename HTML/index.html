        <h3>Interactive Design Process</h3>
        <div class="paragraphs">
          <p>
            The main goal when desinging this website was to creative a simple
            and fully comprehendable website, that proves efficent information
            without clouding the viewing with numerous amounts of content that
            they may not even know how to use and understand
          </p>
          <p>
            The website has a single page, making it easy to flow through its
            numerous sections by scrolling down or using the functional buttons
            allowed at the top of the screen. This enforces two basic and
            evidently the same laws of navigating the website ensuring a user
            will not get lost when interacting with the website.
          </p>
          <p>The website contains the following interface elements.</p>
          <p>
            <span>Buttons: </span>There are a few buttons found on the website
            those that are included are found in the header and profile section
            and each serves to take the user to a specific be it an area in the
            website or external links.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Dropdowns:</span> When scrolling down the website the header
            turns into a drop down that is always present at the top of the site
            displaying the navigation buttons of the website. On smaller screens
            navigation buttons are hidden and only the toggle dropdown is
            visible.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Icons: </span> The only icons present in the website are the
            social media links and the drop down bar icon
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of minimalistic interface elements is to give firstly a
            simple and minimalistic aesthetic to the website and secondly,
            because those are the only button necessary for the website.
          </p>
          <h3>Style guide</h3>
          <p>The aim is to create a minimalistic website</p>
          <p>
            The use of a small range of colours (black,white,wheat, whitesmoke
            and sandy brown) help with this as the two none shades go well with
            one another being of similar shades and smokewhite adds a different
            feel from the ever-present white
          </p>
          <h3>Implementation notes</h3>
          <p>
            The arrangement of the content of the website follws the logic of
            seperating concerns, through putting things that are related to one
            another together
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Semantics</span> used are relevant to the content their
            display, as seen through the effecient use of "p tags" in this
            design section
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no CSS or JavaScript in-line scripting as there is relevant
            linking to each necessary document

            <p>
              Coming into this course I expected to in a way learn more code
              that was more website based, although it is a combination of
              theory and practical work, it seems like the ideal place to learn
              and actively use coding techniques, especially in an art space
              where you have the freedom to create and display things in a
              manner that you see fit. So, it allows me to dive into a new space
              of learning code whilst providing the opportunity to learn how I
              can best use that code in ways that will help in my artistic
              endeavours. Being introduced to a new course can always be a new
              and interesting challenge given that the majority of the time you
              are being presented with new ideas you may or may not be familiar
              with and Interactive Media is no exception to this thought.
              Although there was no intense information being presented to us as
              it was only the first week and we were only being introduced to
              topics and setting things up, there was one thing that already
              seemed like a challenge: navigating GitHub. Understanding how to
              manipulate projects in the main repository and creating new
              repositories that can in turn affect projects in other
              repositories whilst also not affecting them was a lot in my
              opinion. Of course, this will become something easier to do once I
              regularly use GitHub but when it was presented it seemed complex
              to use. Vannevar Bush’s “As we may think” was an interesting read
              as it is fascinating to see someone’s ideal situation for how far
              technology will advance from a time when there was barely advanced
              technology (of course at the time radio was a huge advancement
              however this is comparison is to modern technology). Bush was a
              brilliant mind for being able to essentially predict what we now
              know as the internet before it was even a thought during his time.

            <h3>Week 2</h3>
            <p>
              When I first got into coding HTML was one of the easiest languages
              I could learn, and this is very true. From what we have learned,
              to the exercises we had to complete, engaging with HTML has been
              one of the easiest things I have to do, throughout this whole
              degree. The concepts, formatting and syntax are very easy to
              understand if you have some form of coding background and even if
              you have no coding experience HTML is a very easy language to
              grasp. Having made a website, despite it lacking any information
              and information was also very exciting. Internet Histories
              unfortunately was a horrible experience for me. The reasoning
              behind this is simply I do not like learning about anything
              related to history. I am not fond of anything that has to do with
              history and the fact that all that information about how the
              internet has progressed over time will not do anything for me
              besides be interesting facts adds to my disfavour of the topic.
              The content itself is interesting as it is interesting knowing
              where this started however to that extent of information whereby
              it resembles a history. Lawson Bronson’s article was a good read
              given it gives pointers on some good practices in HTML (such as
              not overloading on h1’s) and the uses of various semantics used in
              HTML coding (such as why using nav’s, articles and sections is
              important). It is a helpful tool book of good practices that can
              help you code better in HTML.

              CSS styling so far seems to not have much difficulty to it however
              with making things look good, being accurate and perfect with your
              output becomes a factor and that in the long run could be a
              decisive factor to how hard things are in terms of website styling
              techniques I will be using. I feel something that CSS takes into
              consideration (with help from HTML) is how it is important to make
              your websites easily accessible, in terms of how you use your
              website and find your website. This draws on last week’s point on
              semiotics and it seems semiotics is a general practice that can
              you design well-functional and engaging websites. In terms of my
              website, there are ideas slowly creeping up as I learn more about
              how to make efficient websites I am also looking to draw
              inspiration from websites from companies like Nike, Off-White and
              Dior. These companies particularly intrigue me because firstly I
              like fashion but also how easy it is to navigate the website,
              especially Dior’s website which provides information in text and
              graphics (in a manner whereby one does not overpower the other)
              format which I believe is something that is often overlooked
              especially in websites whereby you are trying to be sold
              something. Always having to read is not ideal as people have
              varied attention spans and some people would rather see a video
              showing information than that same video explained in text format.
              And this brings me to the UI/UX text where the main message was
              users should be able to fully enjoy your website. It is not only
              about having a page that shows something, that page should make
              people want to visit it again if not stay longer than they
              currently have. This can be achieved by paying attention to
              important UI/UX elements such as responsiveness, the sizes of
              different types of information, and particular events that can be
              performed by the user (through mouse and keyboard inputs) that may
              affect their experience with the website. The final thought to
              draw upon is why conventions are important. Steven Mailloux
              mentioned how “traditional conventions capture an essential aspect
              of our everyday notion of social convention” so it is important to
              never disregard something simple websites practises (such as the
              back to top button traditionally at the bottom right of every
              screen). As much as it is your website and you always want to add
              your touch to things it is important to not stray too far away
              from the norm because some things are the way they are due to them
              being a socially acceptable functionality. Mailloux, S. (1983).
              Convention and Context. New Literary History, 14(2), p.402.

              Working with JavaScript has been fun and this is mainly due to how
              it reminds me somewhat of C#. From the tasks we were prescribed to
              the content we learned, JavaScript has a lot of similarities to C#
              and thus understanding JavaScript’s syntax and practices so far
              has been easier than expected. This can change however as we dive
              deeper into JavaScript’s actual use (website functionality)
              however I foresee this not to be as daunting as it may seem at
              face value. The reading on The Basic Principles of design was very
              helpful of giving me a new perspective when trying to design my
              website and also make me look at most websites in a different
              light. As mentioned in a previous week most of my styling and
              design inspirations will come from fashion websites such as
              dior.com, nike.com and off---white.com these websites don’t really
              take into account basic design principles such as place users at
              the centre as information will take up the entire screen at once,
              reducing cognitive load is also not followed due to the vast
              majority of information a user has to take in when browsing the
              website and also aiming for simplicity. This could be due the fact
              these are fashion websites and fashion is considered loud and in
              your face so they could be an exception to some rules but for a
              beginner they shouldn’t be a full guide. This lead to my
              researching more websites and finding some interesting designs
              such as seed.com who try and draw the users attention to a central
              focal point or even eumray.com which is a essentially a portfolio
              sight. What I like most about emuray.com is how its as if the
              creator was trying to flex their UI/UX design capabilities to show
              that this is who they are and this is what they are capable of.
              This website makes for a good starting point for a creative person
              as you are trying to make yourself look good and going towards the
              simplistic and conventional way of designing a website may not
              make you stand out but rather hold you back. With this considered
              it may be time for me to rethink my current wireframes and be more
              experimental with the design of my website.

              For these two weeks there was a lot of time spent reevaluating my
              designs. A large part of this was through redesign the wireframes
              for certain sections of my website and experiment with UI elements
              that would make my elements more enjoyable when scroll through it
              (without leaving the viewer lost) As of the end of week 6 the
              website is functional at a basic level as it contains a homepage
              that takes you more areas of the website, it is easy to navigate
              and there is efficient information for section/area of the website
              you will encounter. Aesthetics are something I look towards
              improving on as this website being a portfolio sight I want it to
              look as appealing as the person it is portraying. There are a few
              challenges with visually pleasing affects I have a encountered
              however this is mainly due to my newness to the area of media
              queries in CSS.
